# IntegrableModelforResonances
Numerical routines utilized in "An Integrable Model for the Dynamics of Planetary Mean Motion Resonances" [(Hadden 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05264) along with some jupyter notebooks illustrating example applications.

The code requries a few special python packages (in addition to numpy and scipy):

  - `theano`
  - `exoplanet`
  - `celmech`
  - `rebound`
  
All packages can be installed with:

  `pip install [PACKAGE]`

Code reproducing Figure 7 of [H19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05264) is included in the `jupyter_examples` folder.
