# IntegrableModelforResonances
Numerical routines utilized in "An Integrable Model for the Dynamics of Planetary Mean Motion Resonances" [CITE] along with some jupyter notebooks illustrating example applications.

The code requries a few special python packages (in addition to numpy and scipy):

  - `theano`
  - `exoplanet`
  - `celmech`
  - `rebound`
All packages can be installed using:

  `pip install [PACKAGE]`
